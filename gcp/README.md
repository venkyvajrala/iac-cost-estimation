We do not have any native IAC code cost estimation tool available for GCP

We can still use infracost, terraform cloud, scalr like multi cloud tools to get cost estimation for GCP



Infracost: https://www.infracost.io/docs/supported_resources/google/ <br>
Terraform cloud: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/cost-estimation/gcp
